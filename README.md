# MNIST Dataset

Welcome to the GitHub page of DeepTrackAI's MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits and is widely used for training and evaluating machine learning and deep learning models.

## Description

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a grayscale picture of a digit, and the associated label is the digit value (from 0 to 9).

- **Dataset Size**: 70,000 images
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels
- **Color**: Grayscale
- **Labels**: 10 (0 through 9)

## Usage

### Via Command Line

To clone the repository and access the MNIST dataset:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/deeplay.git
cd deeplay
```

### Programmatically in Python

If you want to load the dataset directly into a Python script or Jupyter notebook:

```python
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from zipfile import ZipFile

# URL to the repository (modify this if the dataset is hosted in a specific location or file)
DATASET_URL = 'https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/deeplay/raw/main/mnist_dataset.zip'

response = requests.get(DATASET_URL)
with ZipFile(BytesIO(response.content)) as z:
    z.extractall()

# Now you can load the dataset using your preferred library, e.g., deeplay, PyTorch, TensorFlow.
```
